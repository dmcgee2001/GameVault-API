Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame &amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!Dinosaurs, Creatures, &amp; Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management.

Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new \"Engrams\" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D \"Explorer Notes\". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio.

The sixth major installment in the Resident Evil series, it was originally released for the GameCube in 2005. Players control U.S. government special agent Leon S. Kennedy, who is sent on a mission to rescue the U.S. president's daughter Ashley Graham, who has been kidnapped by a cult. In a rural part of Europe, Leon fights hordes of villagers infected by a mind-controlling parasite, and reunites with the spy Ada Wong.Development began for PlayStation 2 in 1999. Four proposed versions were discarded; the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami. In a departure from the fixed camera angles and slower survival horror gameplay of previous instalments, the team focused on developing more dynamic shooting action.Resident Evil 4 was announced as a GameCube exclusive as part of the Capcom Five, but was ported to numerous formats, becoming a cross-platform hit, selling over 10 million copies across all platforms. It garnered acclaim for its narrative, gameplay, voice acting, and characters, and is often named one of the best video games, winning multiple Game of the Year awards in 2005. It influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person genres, popularizing the \"over-the-shoulder\" third-person view. Resident Evil 5 was released in 2009.GameplayThe player controls the protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, from a third-person perspective. Departing significantly from the series' previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.Resident Evil 4 adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, players can interact with the environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, dodging an attack or executing a \"finishing move\" on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events, in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game's many boss fights, in which the player must avoid instant-kill attacks.The main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados (\"The Cattle\" in Spanish). Los Ganados can dodge, wield melee and projectile weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other.The inventory system features a grid system, represented by an attaché case, that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition, and healing items are kept in the case, while key items and treasures are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.Capcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases. The largest addition is \"Separate Ways\", a minigame which focuses on Ada Wong's involvement in Resident Evil 4 and her connection to the series' villain Albert Wesker. \"Ada's Report\", a five-part documentary, analyzes Ada's relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot. Other unlockable content in all versions includes the minigames \"The Mercenaries\" and \"Assignment Ada\" (using Ada to retrieve Las Plagas samples), new costumes for Leon and Ashley, new weapons, and a cutscene browser.PlotU.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S. President's daughter, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult. He travels to a nameless rural village in Spain, where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Illuminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas.While in the village, Leon is captured by its chief, Bitores Mendez, and injected with Las Plagas. He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano), a former Los Illuminados researcher. The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her. They both escape from the church after Osmund Saddler (Michael Gough), leader of Los Illuminados, reveals his plan to use the plaga they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with a \"sample\" once she returns home, allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world.After killing Mendez, Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more Illuminados under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica), another of Saddler's henchmen who owns the castle, and the two become separated by Salazar's traps. Meanwhile, Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon and Ashley's infection, as well as a sample of Las Plagas. He brings the two items to Leon but is killed by Saddler, who takes the sample, while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon's hands. While in the castle, Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill), a woman from his past who supports him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.Afterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping. Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample. Suspicious of the mercenary's intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit. After Krauser's fatal defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler, and with Ada's help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island explodes.", user_id: nil},

It’s designed as a rogue-like twist on the linear nature of the original SUPERHOT. In it’s well proven genre-defining format, SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE distills and expands on the same intoxicating rhythm of slow motion combat.The game will force you through dozens of increasingly difficult time-moves-only-when-you-move gameplay challenges. Each challenge will make you more powerful and bring you closer to deciphering the secrets hidden from you by the system. As you unlock powerful abilities and gain access to new playable characters, so will your enemies grow stronger, smarter and more desperate to stop you.Come and join the fray. Play in Early Access. Let the system learn from you.SUPERHOT rogue-like expansion early access hype! What to expect now?We’re still a good 9-12 months away from a full release, so please don’t forget that this is nowhere close to a complete, satisfying experience just yet. The current build of MIND CONTROL DELETE is the first time we’re inviting you to check out a few of the brand new gameplay systems that are going to be central to the game:First 2 playable MINDS, each with it’s own unique ability and gameplay modifiersA kaleidoscope of the first dozen new gameplay levels that mix into the first few dozen combat challengesNew animation and AI systems to drive new weapons, abilities, and enemy typesHitpoint system and power-up store to give you that extra oompf needed to crush your enemies and see them driven before youProcedural rogue-like run generation baked into the core gameplay loop, enabling us to tell longer, more complex stories and deliver tons more of satisfying skill-based gameplayBeware though - this is an extremely early, bleeding-edge version of most of those systems. The limitations for this early access build are not for the faint of heart:No story whatsoever - we don’t want to spoil too much too quickly so this and the next few updates will be all about gameplay featuresNo advanced power-ups or new enemy types enabled yet - we want to establish and test the balance of vanilla gameplay in this build, waiting to sprinkle in gamebreaking modifiers and new foes to beat up until future updatesNo replay or point system - easy bragging about your insane skills will need to waitAbsolutely no hidden menu minigames yet - we have so many new cool ones coming out super soon tho &lt;3If you’re not looking for an incomplete game that’s in constant flux and relies on your feedback and creativity to expand, or if you’d rather just play a finished experience that’s guaranteed to challenge and satisfy you and your deepest power fantasies, then we totally recommend you should wait until MIND CONTROL DELETE is out of early access.However, if you’re super brave and want to help guide the development in its earliest stages, then go ahead - join us, and get your name in the credits!Why are you putting MIND CONTROL DELETE in early access in the first place tho?We released the original SUPERHOT in February 2016 after nearly two years of intense creative crunch. The amazing support during the development from our Kickstarter backers and the exhilarating reaction we got from you once the game released was simply mind blowing.With morale at an all-time high, we immediately jumped into a flurry of prototyping and refining gameplay and story concepts that we weren’t able to fit into the original game. We tested and put a bunch of them to work in virtual reality, and after releasing SUPERHOT VR to even more outstanding support from you guys, we finally had a road map for the first non-VR expansion ironed out in December 2016. In our usual no-compromise approach to design, we made that roadmap way more ambitious than originally anticipated and we decided to make the expansion a fully standalone game, allowing us to rewrite and reimagine all of our major gameplay systems.The single most important strength of the original SUPERHOT was the amazing involvement of tens of thousands of creative alpha and beta testers that helped us shape and balance the game and drove us to pursue zero compromises in design. After over a year of work on MIND CONTROL DELETE, we’re now ready to start this adventure together again. We’re inviting you to jump in and co-create the game with us. Talk to us, work with us, and let’s build the build the biggest SUPERHOT yet together.What’s the price tag on this? Is this that free DLC you were talking about?Yup! Way bigger than the usual free DLC though, so it'll take a bit longer to release. If you own the original SUPERHOT on Steam now or buy it while MIND CONTROL DELETE is still in Early Access, you’ll get the full expansion for free once it’s finished and released.However if you can’t wait to work with us, and you feel like bravely facing rough edges and helping shape the game as it develops, then we’ll be thrilled to have you sign your name to a piece of SUPERHOT history and join us in Early Access right now.Once MIND CONTROL DELETE releases in earnest, it will be priced same as the other SUPERHOT games for everyone who’s still new to the franchise.FAQShould I buy MIND CONTROL DELETE if I haven’t played the original SUPERHOT?Not right now. The game will be a totally standalone experience in a few updates, but the lack of clear structure and story right now would be confusing for newcomers. Definitely get the original SUPERHOT though. It’s lots of fun.What’s the update roadmap?We’re new to Early Access, but we’re hoping to use your feedback and collaboration to drive and guide the development. We have a bunch of large features already in the pipeline that we’ll be dropping on livestream updates every few weeks, starting with the first major content update dropping in January, and following with balance and feature updates released on a monthly / bi-monthly schedule.I really want X in the game, how do I make you want to do X too?The discussions around the game are taking place on Steam Community, Discord and Reddit groups. Join us, make yourself heard, and rally up your fellow players. We’ll tap into your creative hivemind. We’ll put your ideas into life.Your mind will make the system stronger.

Six months later it hadn't met its rendezvous point at the Cape of Good Hope and was declared lost at sea.  Early this morning of October 14th, 1807, the Obra Dinn drifted into port with sails damaged and no visible crew.

There'll be less creativity with the gameplay and instead I want to experiment with the rendering, story, and a few technical features. Right now I have only a rough idea about the narrative. I'm hoping to capture a compelling mystery with suspense and twists in the limited space of an old merchant sailing ship. It won't be the typical \"collect items and look for clues\" structure. There's a slightly cool gameplay hook but I won't go into details on that until much later.DevlogI'll try to keep this (https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=40832.0) devlog lively as I make progress. Because the gameplay itself is more standard, there probably won't be as many creative updates as the Papers Please devlog. I will post lots of pictures and builds as soon as I'm able. Things will likely also move slower than Papers Please did too, at least at the start. P,P still takes a good amount of my time so there's less chance for me to maintain a laser-like focus on one project like last time. The lower bound for finishing this game is around 3 months but realistically I think it'll take me around half a year. My Maya skills are pretty rusty so I expect the modeling/animation to take the most time.1-bit RenderingMy first computer was a Mac Plus. I've always had a nostalgia-softened spot in my heart for 1-bit graphics. I'd like to capture the detailed black &amp; white look of old Mac games in a realtime 1st person game. I plan to push it grittier and less cartoon-like than those old games; the hard part will be keeping everything legible without it becoming an unreadable mess of dithered pixels. One interesting problem with 1-bit rendering is that it doesn't scale well for images and it compresses to video like shit - so YouTube stuff may look really poor. We'll see how it goes.Unity 3DI'm gonna use Unity for this one. I fell in love with Haxe/OpenFL on my last project but unfortunately the 3D situation is not that great there yet. Also, it's time to finally see why 90% of the indie scene is using Unity. I have a good amount of experience with 3D games and the few days I've played around with Unity so far have been pretty productive. The animated title screen scene up there (with post-processing shaders and all) was created in one day. I now have unrealistically high hopes.", user_id: nil},

The famous difficulty of previous games is still there but the world is much simpler yet connected and dangerous. Enemies still respond after death of a player but only about 15 times.

Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune.You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world.Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, and illnesses.Fashion structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, or futuristic materials.Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts.Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses.Fight pirate raiders, hostile tribes, rampaging animals, giant tunnelling insects and ancient killing machines.Trade with passing ships and trade caravans.Decorate your colony to make it into a pleasurable space.Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires.Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery.Discover a new generated world each time you play.Build colonies in the desert, jungle, tundra, and more.Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor.RimWorld is a story generator. It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.Your colonists are not professional settlers – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well.Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert plain, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.And there's much more than that!

The game represents a unique and unforgettable experience as it transports players in a weird town which crouches, ominous, in the far reaches of an ancient steppe. It was once a small drover settlement, huddled around a monstrous abattoir—but something about the butchery it was near has changed it. It has developed an odd social structure over the course of several generations. It could have quietly continued along its weird way, but a sudden outbreak of an unknown and inevitably lethal disease has decimated the citizens. Prayers did not help. Science did not help. So, finally, they have turned to outsiders for help: three of them enter the town in hope of finding a cure or—failing that—an explanation. The first outsider was a ruthless investigator, assigned by local authorities. The second is a far-sighted Ripper who has used his extraordinary abilities to gain a reputation as an ingenious surgeon, who has come to the town in search of his father's terrible heritage. The third—and last—outsider is an eccentric girl rumored to have mystic healing abilities; she may become the town's salvation were it not for the constant fear that plagues her, the memory of the horrors of her recent past.On the surface, Pathologic is a first person horror adventure game where you control one of three \"heroes.\" Dig deeper, however, and you’ll find an experience that will affect your emotional and psychological state. In the world of Pathologic you’ll find yourself in situations where morals and good deeds are meaningless in the face of raw despair and endless need. Talk to the denizens of the town and decide for yourself if you wish to ease someone else’s pain or save every bit of precious medicine to protect yourself from the invisible and inexorable plague. Become witness to the miasma of horror as the plague begins to overcome the town.Brand New in-house English script: For the first time ever, the game has cast off the major issue that had previously disallowed international audiences from accessing it.Brand New Voice-overs.New content: A certain amount of text that had previously been cut from the international version of the game have now been restoredUpdated textures and higher resolutions support.New visual effects.Newly Included Fan-Made Polish translation: thanks to the hard work and generosity of Jakub Derdziak &amp; Aldona Derdziak.An Italian translation, kindly donated to us by the original translators of the game, Stefano Gaburri and Claudio Todeschini.An indie cult classic.12 days in a plague-ridden town.

Delivering a fresh new take on the Narrative Adventure, your choices and character growth truly matter. Make hard-hitting decisions, but also develop an array of skills to directly impact how the story unfolds. With permanent, long-lasting consequences, there is no going back. Plunge into a tale of intrigue and manipulation in the style of a classic murder mystery, living with a cast of alluring characters each hiding their own dark secrets. Trust no one while uncovering dire truths – no matter the cost to mind and body.The Council begins in 1793, with players taking the role of secret society member Louis de Richet after his invitation to a private island off the shores of England by the enigmatic Lord Mortimer. Joining him are a number of high profile guests, including Napoleon Bonaparte and President of the newly-formed United States of America, George Washington. The strange nature of this private reception goes beyond just the prestigious guests –Richet’s own mother has recently gone missing on the island, while each and every one of the colorful cast seems to have their own hidden agendas.In a new twist for the genre, the core of The Council’s gameplay comes from manipulating and maneuvering through character encounters using the unique Social Influence system. During confrontations, skills and limited resources can be used to gain the upper hand and achieve the desired outcome. Players will be rewarded for their knowledge of each character’s psychological vulnerabilities and immunities, as well as their preparations made during prior exploration and investigation. Failing an encounter does not mean ‘game over’, and no action can be taken back. The consequences are permanent, and may result in persistent physical disfigurements or mental traits that help or hinder the rest of the player’s adventure.Richet’s numerous skills can be developed to align with your chosen approach to the adventure. Solve issues with diplomacy, delve into occultism to expand your historical and scientific knowledge, or play detective and see what others do not perceive. Your skills will have uses that extend far beyond your conversations with fellow guests. With 15 diverse skills to use and invest in, players are free to uncover The Council’s mysteries how they see fit, with wildly varying consequences depending on their methods. The results will forever alter the life of Louis de Richet, of those around him, and shape history as we know it.", user_id: nil},

The singularity is doing more than simply distorting the fabric of space and time; based on the time of the orbit, enemies in the levels get crazier or struck by fear, unknown entities roam the corridors and dozens of other mysterious events can occur.Hellpoint is based on a peculiar structure called the Quantic System. It is a series of interconnected systems that are utilizing a server clock to decide when and where a particular dynamic event should occur. You can see a preview of that system in our demo linked below. You venture in a corridor that you previously walked through, and suddenly a new passage is opened. A tall menacing mini-boss is now patrolling where there was no one before. Enemies cower in fear as you approach them, or charge you in a fit of rage. A boss suddenly grows tougher and more aggressive, but also drops more valuable loot. It is up to you to figure out what events happen where and when so that you can exploit them to your advantage.In Hellpoint, the Black Hole is truly the master of the dungeon.Irid Novo was once a shining beacon of intergalactic collaboration, built to research advanced artificial intelligence and quantum mechanics. Now, it is a dark and dangerous place dominated by the will of the cosmic gods. It is best to explore Irid Novo with the help of a friend.Hellpoint supports splitscreen co-op and player versus player on all platforms. You can play the whole game with a friend, or have him jump up in and out anytime he likes. The loot is shared, and the experience of player two is saved and not watered down. In our youth, we've had countless nights of couch gaming fun, playing with friends and siblings until the sun rose. With Hellpoint, we want to bring back couch gaming into a genre that we think cruelly lacks it.For centuries, the galaxy has been at peace. With the discovery of interstellar travel and the access to infinite resources that ensued, brutal wars are now a thing of the past. To survive the wrath of cosmic gods and hordes of monsters, you will have to find ancient blueprints and craft long forgotten weapons and armors and acquire forbidden powers. You play the way you want, will it be a sword and a shield, or a firearm and your mastery over the cosmic energies?Hellpoint allows you to play the way you want. Using our crafting and customization system, you can adjust your weapons and powers according to your own play style. Do you prefer your healing power to heal more over time or instantaneously? Go edit your power in one of the crafting station, and make it work the way you like. Would you prefer your energy missiles to explode on impact, or to ricochet off enemies? The choice is yours to modify them as you see fit.The more you fight with a weapon, the more proficient you become with it and eventually you unlock powerful abilities. This can go from an extra long range combo attack to a shattering explosion that sends enemies flying.A terrible quantum cataclysm happened on board Irid Novo and is spreading to the whole multiverse. Piercing the very fabric of space to reach parallel universes is not something mortals should be allowed to play with. However, those breaches into other universes could very well be the key for you to make things right...Every time you start a new game, the station is different. Rooms, enemies, puzzles, events, all are parts of the multiverse. This means that while our level design is carefully hand crafted, no two games are exactly the same. The game stay fresh as you never know what to except around the corner. As you die, you are pulled away from your universe of origin, and you wake up into the next. The more you die, the more the world changes around you.", user_id: nil},

Our approach with the project was to make the kind of game we used to play, something that had both casual appeal and a limitless competitive ceiling. It was also a genre that we felt hasn't been adequately adapted to the modern world of game design. Our vision was simple: build a game that's easy to pick up, hard to master, and fun both on and off screen....AND A BIT ABOUT POLYBALLThere's a lot to do in Polyball -- Challenge yourself or a friend to one of over 60 levels included in the initial release, with plans for many more levels via free DLC. If you've got some friends over and are looking for something to play, Polyball's splitscreen multiplayer promises a good time. With classic modes like Battle and Circuit Race, as well as a multiplayer version of the single-player experience, Polyball promises to be a must-have party game.CASUAL, COMPETITIVE, OR BOTHWith global leaderboards built right into the level select menu and pregame screen, you can see where you stand among the worlds best and race against their ghosts. If you're more interested in beating your friends, check out the friends-only leaderboards. Collecting shards during your single-player journey will unlock a vast array of customization options, from different ball models to particle effects. This customization carries over into online multiplayer matches as well as your high-score ghost, with local multiplayer having its own version of the customization system designed for split-screen play.FOR THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLEIf you've mastered every challenge we put into the game, take a look at the Steam Workshop content to face a whole new set of challenges. Community made content, from multiplayer battle maps and circuit tracks to customization options and single-player levels, will bridge the gap between developer and player as well as provide a steady stream of new content for you to experience.

A detailed strategic layer allows you to co-ordinate the defence of the planet, using your interceptors to shoot down UFOs and researching captured artefacts to learn about your foes and unlock new combat equipment to use on your missions.Xenonauts is a spiritual successor to the classic X-Com strategy games from the 1990s. We aim to improve the graphics, add new content and streamline the interface whilst still retaining all of the key mechanics of the original games. Devoted fans should love this game, but we're also keen to introduce the joys of old-school grand strategy to a whole new generation of players who might not otherwise experience it!Please note that the native Mac / Linux versions of the game are still in beta, however older WINE-wrapped \"ports\" are available and known to be stable whilst development of the native ports is still ongoing.Key Features Ground Combat: Xenonauts delivers tense turn-based combat across realistic, varied and fully-destructible battlefields, against almost fifty different variants of enemy. Missions range from capturing crashed UFOs or alien bases to defending cities (or even Xenonaut facilities) against alien attack. You'll experience the chill of encountering a new alien for the first time and the joys of test-firing a new weapon for the first time. Deeply asymmetric combat keeps the battles interesting - after all, you're fighting intergalactic invaders with 1970's ballistic technology! Strategic Management: You will also be managing the defence of the planet, dealing with the invading alien UFOs with your customisable interceptors. You need to balance the needs of your funding nations with your own. Your funds are limited - are you going to spend them on battlefield equipment, more scientists, or expanding your coverage of the planet? Your priorities must be balanced carefully if you are to win the war. Research Tree: Xenonauts has an extensive research tree with almost a hundred projects to unlock, each with its own unique description and painted artwork. It slowly reveals the intentions and origins of the invaders, while also unlocking new battlefield equipment, aircraft and vehicles for you to use as you harness alien technology and turn it against them.  Persistent Soldiers: Soldiers in Xenonauts are persistent from mission to mission, improving their stats and gaining ranks with combat experience - but their deaths are always only a single bad move away. You will grow to care about the brave men and women under your command as they slowly grow from green rookies into hardened veterans, but that only makes it more painful when their heroic tale is cruelly cut short by a burst of plasma fire... Detailed, Emergent Simulation: Xenonauts contains no scripted missions, just broad rules setting the pace of the invasion. As such, no game plays out the same twice. If you shoot a Scout UFO down over a polar area, you get a Crash Site mission where you can capture a crashed Scout UFO in an Arctic tileset. Commence a battle at night and you'll be fighting the mission in the darkness with reduced sight range. If your base is attacked, you fight the defence in a perfect replica of your base. A lot of time has gone into weaving the two very different halves of the game together into something that feels both natural and enjoyable.", user_id: nil},

Evil spreads, the dead rise, and corruption reigns. Hope is but a faded memory for all but one: a priestess named Kaho from the village of Lun. If only Kaho could somehow gain audience with the Queen, Her Majesty could surely be convinced to lend her power to help save the land and its inhabitants from certain doom―but time is short, and each coming night falls darker than the last...Reverie Under The Moonlight is the fourth installment in the Momodora series of side-scrolling action platformers, featuring melee combos, dodge mechanics, and a plethora of items and spells to unleash upon your enemies. Play casually to fully take in and enjoy the rich setting and engaging, mysterious story, or crank up the difficulty to run your reflexes through a truly brutal gauntlet.Beautifully animated graphicsExciting action gameplay: pull off impressive combos, dodge attacks, and skewer enemies with arrowsIntense boss battles with challenging patterns and epic scaleDifficulty settings appropriate for all types of players―from story and setting lovers to hardcore action enthusiastsA breadth of items that can be combined to facilitate new strategiesAn amazingly diverse world to explore, filled with secrets and treasuresEccentric allies and foes with compelling personalitiesMysterious lore and rich backstory woven into events, dialogue, and item descriptionsFor this fourth installment in the Momodora series―which actually serves a prequel to the previous games―the primary focus during development was on improvements to the gameplay and art. The combat gameplay has truly evolved since the days of Momo III, and the character sprites are now bigger and better animated.We also made an effort to include more tiny details here and there, expand on the world lore, and create more exciting boss battles.I believe this is the best Momodora game in the series, and definitely the most polished title so far.Most of us at Playism grew up playing video games during the early days of the NES, and throughout the years, action-platformers have been some of the staples in our respective game libraries. Long before “Metroidvania” was a thing, we fell in love with the original Castlevania series, as well as with other Hall of Famers such as the Metroid, Contra, and Ninja Gaiden games. About halfway through the lifecycle of the first-generation PlayStation, sprite-based game development took an unfortunate nosedive, and the sorts of games we loved most and grew up with just weren't being made as frequently or, frankly, with as much love and care as they once were.Indie game development really helped to reinvigorate both the sprite-based action-platformer genre and the magic of actual sprite animation. rdein's games combine what we’ve always loved about tight-action 2D gaming with splendid influences from more modern games like Dark Souls. The dedication to your actions necessitated by animation locks; the insane intensity driving the boss fights and how epic it is that this quaint little heroine can tackle these heroic endeavors; the attention to detail in the environments, designs, and animations... all of this stuff is simply stunning and rdein pulls it off to beautiful effect.Then there’s also the story itself, which is also a masterpiece in game storytelling: a strange, mysterious world that you inhabit with countless hopeless souls whom you are trying to save. There is painstaking detail in every item, every snippet of dialogue. You find yourself constantly readjusting how you feel about these people. You're trying to save them, but do they even want to be saved? Or should you be more worried about that awkwardly sinister tone in their voices...?Momodora: RUTM shouldn’t exactly be categorized as “Metroidvania” or “Souls-like”, but there certainly are elements of both contained within. It's a game of its own, and it’s one of the best entries in the mind-bogglingly expansive genre of side-scrolling action-platformers. We at Playism all love the game, and we can state with absolute confidence that if you’ve bothered to read this far, then you certainly will, too.", user_id: nil},

Earthlings survived the invasion of hostile aliens - and were able to repel him. The battles were not even on the planet Earth itself, but at the space station. And at this station there were many traces of carnage. From blood to parts of aliens, from holes in the walls from bullets and shells to broken glass. And now all this must be cleaned, collected, and the garbage must be thrown away. A game about space janitors, and an extraordinary task for them.GameplayIn the course of the game, it is necessary to solve the tasks related to cleaning up of the huge space station, which survived the battle between the inhabitants of the Earth and the alien invaders, from the dirt and debris. It is necessary to remove the most diverse and exotic garbage: remains of bodies of aliens and earthlings, shot casings and broken glass, medicines for the wounded, weapons and who knows what else. It is necessary to wash the floors and walls of blood and soot, to seal holes from bullets in walls, ceilings and floors.As tools, players have a mop to wash out stains, a special device for detecting biological remains, and a PDA. You can interact with garbage and simply with the help of hands.At each level there are devices for cleaning and recycling garbage: an incineration plant, a source of clean water, a container in which smaller debris is placed, such as cans, liners and body parts, a welding device for repairing holes in walls, and a vending machine where the player can get lights, medicines, a \"wet floor\" sign, other signs and lamps. Sometimes these devices work incorrectly and produce even more pollution.The player can figure out how to use improvised tools to speed up and simplify cleaning. On the other hand, the player should think about how his actions will affect the situation and will not lead to even more pollution and the need to clean the same place several times.After passing each level, the player enters the so-called \"The Office\". This is the place where the work done at this level is summed up. The player sees what he missed to draw conclusions for the future. In this place you can also get things as a reward for the work done.The cleaning takes up any amount of time, but there are penalties for poorly executed work. If less than 75% of the territory is taken away, the player can be fired and he will lose all the accumulated achievements.Additions.There are several additions to the game.

Featuring seasonal content updates, regular tournaments, item drops, full support of Steam Community Market – and more!HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS GAME?Gremlins, Inc. is designed for up to 6 players, in multiplayer or in single-player mode (with AI bots). Each player has 6 cards on their hand (replenished from the same deck) and uses them either to move around the playing field or to perform different game actions. There is a lot of interaction with other players, and duels are significantly different from 3-player or 4-player games. You can play until a certain score limit, or until agreed number of rounds, or for time limit. The game offers both custom and ranked sessions (with matchmaking by rating).CAN YOU PLAY IN TEAMS OR JUST WATCH?Yes, you can! In addition to custom sessions (where you define the parameters of the session and may optionally set filters for those who can join you) and password-protected private sessions (so that you and your friends can play undisturbed), the game offers team mode (2x2, 3x3, or 2x2x2) with teams of human players and/or AI bots. Gremlins, Inc. also supports a built-in spectator mode, which allows you to watch sessions of other players right from inside of the game, sharing your emotions with players and other spectators through messages and emoticons.CAN YOU PLAY THIS GAME OFFLINE?Certainly! When you buy this game, you get 2 products in your Steam Library: Gremlins, Inc. – the edition that is playable online in single-player and multiplayer modes, with full support of item drops and Steam Workshop; and Gremlins vs Automatons – the edition that is playable offline in single-player mode, without any connection to our server whatsoever.HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PLAY ONE SESSION?The game offers different session settings to make them fit your available time, and single-player mode offers automatic SAVE / LOAD function at every turn so that you can take a break whenever you want (while multiplayer mode offers re-connect functionality as long as the session is still in progress). A quick duel for 20 score points with a fast timer can finish in under 20 minutes, while a 4-player session for 60 rounds can last for 2 hours or more.SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM STRATEGIES?There are different types of cards in the game (permanent, regular, secret and criminal) and as each card can be used either to move or for action, you will develop both short-term and long-term strategies for making the most out of where you are, and what you currently have in your hand. Normally, you spend half of your game time accumulating resources and building the foundation for the end-game, and the other half trying to control the progress of your opponents (stealing, arresting, initiating player conflicts, and so on). The more you play, the more new strategies you will discover – especially when combining the effects of several cards played in a combination.MAKE DECISIONS, PLAN YOUR MOVESThis is an intense strategy game: make decisions at every round! Plan your moves, then adjust to the actions of the other players and new cards drawn.The design of the playing field and the multiple layers of optional features (that you can turn on or off, as you wish) allow for a variety of strategies. The more you play, the more roads to victory you discover, using a combination of features based on the particular setup of the session.The game offers a diverse resource system that allows for many comeback chances even after you're robbed or arrested (or both). With score, money, votes, malice, income and bribes, the tension often remains until the very last round.The multilayer mode of the game features a system of ratings, ladders and ranked sessions: compete in a specific league, and take part in the regularly organised tournaments with over 1,000 participants. A system of anonymous masks allows everyone to compete on equal terms in a ranked session.Additionally, the game offers over 10 single-player challenges plus the option to create custom single-player sessions with different settings and a different mix of AI bots.Finally, there's the team mode where victory is determined not only by strategic skill, but also by communication and coordination of each team, which is an entirely different layer of game mechanics.FACTS &amp; FIGURES179 cards in the main deck (143 of them – unique): permanent, regular, secret and criminal, each with a hand-drawn steampunk illustration; with each Season update, we keep adding several new cards to the deck.38 events in the Misfortune deck: these are the special events triggered at certain moments in the game, and may affect the current standing of all players to a significant degree, especially when used on a specific opponent.6 special Chaos Cards: this is an optional set of cards available to every player in the game; turn them on or off to change the dynamics of the session.12 sets of Character Abilities: another optional feature that brings to the game special game mechanics unique to each character type; playing with these makes different competing strategies even more pronounced.11 original locations: the Office, the Plant, the Dump, the Marketplace, the Inferno, the Jail, the Casino, the Court, the Treasure, the Bank and the Astral Plane; and 7 original spot types: Risk, Gamble, Police, Income, Bribe, Misfortune and Tribune.Finally, the game took us three years to develop from concept to full release, and we're still committed to continue supporting the community through development of new content. There are currently over 120,000 players of Gremlins, Inc. on Steam from all over the world, including USA, Russia, China, Japan, UK and France. Collectively, players launched over one million game sessions in the three months since its release.FINALLY, WHO ARE THE GREMLINS?You think that’s just a pocket watch in your hand, a watch that’s a bit late because you keep forgetting to wind it up? No, no and no – you couldn’t be further from the truth! What you carry around is a whole gremlin town packed into this tiny mechanism: a town with its own bank, its own casino… and even its own jail! Gremlins are the microscopic creatures that inhabit any mechanism that they can possibly infiltrate. If a watch or a telescope malfunctions, then it’s probably due to gremlins who took up a residence there.More than anything in life, gremlins value money, political power and prestige: prestige that one can claim after completing some sort of a grandiose engineering project. Aside from working on their own projects, gremlins mostly spend their time preventing other gremlins from building something even more grandiose. This they achieve through bribing officials and lying to the electorate, as well through stealing from their competitors - and outright arresting them.A DISCLAIMER (JUST IN CASE)We felt it important to note that Gremlins, Inc. is not a free-to-play game. Also, this is not a CCG or TCG: you do not need to buy boosters or packs; in every session the game offers the same deck to every player, and everyone's chances are equal.OUR DLC POLICYWe are committed to the principle of continuously updating the game with new features and new game content that come as regular updates, FREE to every owner of the product. At the same time, from time to time we release DLCs that feature fun cosmetic content. If you like it, you can support our efforts by your purchase. However, there is absolutely no pressure to own any of the DLCs in order to play the game or compete in the tournaments. Every player, whether they have DLCs or not, has access to the same game features and the same game mechanics.The game also supports crafting: once you find a blueprint of a specific item, you can create as many such items as you wish, as long as you have the required number of charges (you get charges when you convert other in-game items that you do not want, or have multiple copies of). Finally, the game has its own Steam Item Store where we sell a very small number of unique items that influence the item meta-game (but they have no effect on the game mechanics).ONLINE &amp; OFFLINE VERSIONSGremlins, Inc. was designed as a digital board game with the multiplayer mode at its heart. However, this is not to say that we don't like single-player – we do, and there's a separate section with the single-player challenges as well as the mode where you can create any custom single-player session that you like! One of the products that you receive with this game, Gremlins, Inc., features both single-player and multiplayer modes, and requires that your game client is connected to both Steam and the game's server at all times – in order to support item drops, Steam Community Market and Steam Workshop. The other product that is included with the game, Gremlins vs Automatons, features single-player mode and is designed specifically to be played offline.AMSTERDAM AND SINGAPORE SERVERSThe game currently supports 2 separate servers: Amsterdam and Singapore. Players are able to check their ping value for each of these servers, and play on the server that is the most convenient. Each server has its own player ladder, statistics and player profiles. Most players choose Amsterdam, since ping to Amsterdam from anywhere in the world rarely exceeds 300. However, as we saw more and more players from the Asian region join the game, especially from China, we added the server in Singapore in order to be able to offer faster connection specifically to these players. We hope that this works well for every player, as good player experience is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the quality of our server/client connection in order to adapt the servers to the changing requirements and we thank you for your patience.", user_id: nil},

For the first time, the authentic gunplay and visceral first-person action of the Red Orchestra series is coming to an era of automatic rifles, man-portable grenade launchers and more modern weapons systems. Rising Storm 2: Vietnam casts players into a brutal, authentic recreation of the Vietnam War.Rising Storm 2: Vietnam offers intense tactical action for up to 64 players in battles between the US forces and the Vietnamese, with each force having their own unique abilities and tactical advantages such as Napalm Strikes, Artillery Barrages, surface-to-air missiles, traps, ambushes and more. A variety of authentic period weapons available including the M16, M14, M60, M79 and M3 Grease Gun for the Americans; and the Type 56 Assault Rifle (a Chinese copy of the famous AK-47), RPG-7, MAT-49, SKS Carbine and many, many more for the Vietcong. Weapons also have a wide range of functionality with in-game implications, including adjustable stocks, attachable bayonets, and a new and advanced recoil system which builds on the already phenomenal weapon handling that the Red Orchestra series is famous for. Players on the US team will be able to pilot 3 different helicopters - the UH-1H \"Huey\" transport, the OH-6 \"Loach\" light recon and the powerful AH-1G \"Cobra\" attack helicopter. Play as both the United States Military and Vietnamese resistance fighters. Rising Storm 2: Vietnam allows players to control either the U.S. Army and Marines Corps or the militarized and guerrilla forces of North Vietnam - the NVA and the Viet Cong.Each map faithfully recreates the look of the Vietnam experience and aims to pull players directly into the war with its extreme authenticity to real life. Maps will include the famous jungles of Vietnam, but will also cover battles that occurred in cities, on rolling hills, in US Firebases, Rice Fields, Plantations and many more authentic locations.Game types include Red Orchestra's classic territory control mode, the new Supremacy mode, for large-scale combat including helicopters, VC tunnels and more, as well as the new smaller Skirmish mode and maps designed for 16 or less players. These new smaller maps are designed to be a more competitive, squad-based experience that reflect the small unit actions that Vietnam is famous for.Enhanced squad system that allows players to set up squads as they want them - name them, add their friends, set the squad tag color in game. Once in game, easy identification of your squad in the world and on maps - and dedicated VOIP channels for the squad, as well as bonuses for working together.Rising Storm 2: Vietnam's focus will be player skill and balance. We won't be locking content like weapon upgrades, improved player characteristics or new armaments behind a rank or experience system. We want to put the tools to succeed in the hands of every player.Rising Storm 2: Vietnam will allow players to customize their player characters with additional uniform and equipment variants earned as they play. These will include new headgear, clothing, tattoos, glasses and more.", user_id: nil},

You are the X-Morph - an alien species that invades Earth to harvest its resources and terraform the surface. Strategize in the build mode by carefully selecting various types of alien towers or throw yourself right into heat of the battle. Build mazes for incoming enemies in an environment that provides exceptional planning freedom. Tear down buildings and collapse bridges to support your defense or to simply indulge in a spectacle of unprecedented destruction. Possess a range of unique alien weapons and use defense strategies like you've never seen before in this genre.Your goal is to defend the X-Morph harvesters from waves of incoming human forces. Each enemy wave is preceded by a setup phase in which the player can check what types of enemies are going to be attacking him and to observe their paths. There is no time limit for this phase, so the player can carefully plan his defenses or choose to start fighting immediately and place towers when needed during the battle. One of the game's key features is the ability to build towers virtually anywhere on the map and to shape enemy paths by connecting towers with laser fences. The player can choose between building long mazes out of basic towers or placing more advanced towers which are more effective at different types of incoming enemies. Advanced tower types specialize in dealing with specific enemy types e.g. flame towers are great for destroying fast moving ground units, artillery towers are best at countering large groups of slow enemies, anti air laser is ideal for shooting down heavy bombers.As the X-Morph fighter you can engage enemy units directly with a diverse arsenal of weapons. You can morph into four distinct forms which specialize in dealing with different kinds of threats. Each form has a basic attack and a special charged attack mode. The Plasma Fighter is the most universal form - good at destroying both air and ground units. The Dark Matter Bomber is great at decimating groups of ground units. It can also slow down time and release a dark matter bomb that can cut down buildings. The Shredder fighter is perfect for annihilating large numbers of human air units and clearing the sky. Finally the Laser Destroyer is best for smelting large single units. It can also charge up a gravitational anomaly that sucks in smaller enemy units.  A large variety of weapons and enemies along with a dynamic, fully destructible environment provides a rich arcade shooter experience.The game's environments are constructed with a lot of attention to detail and they are almost completely destructible. From small picket fences to huge skyscrapers. Any bridge or building in the game can be collapsed and it's destruction is dynamically simulated using realistic physics. The destruction is not only a visual effect as it can significantly influence the layout of the battlefield. The combination of dynamic environments, laser fences and real time calculated enemy paths creates unique gameplay scenarios.Humans are desperate to defend their home world. They have created huge, building size, mechanical war machines to fight against each other, but now they will use them to destroy the X-Morph. Each boss fight is unique and heavily influences the gameplay environment. Entire cities will be destroyed.X-Morph: Defence includes a split screen co-op mode. All missions have different gameplay scenarios designed specifically for co-op play. Enemies attack in larger numbers and from new directions making good cooperation essential to winning. In this mode the game can be played in many different ways, one player can focus on optimizing tower placement while the other shoots at enemies or they can both focus their firepower on the strongest attackers.", user_id: nil},

The game appeared on the PC and on the most popular consoles of its generation: Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.The story and the settingThe plot of the game tells about Jason, and the action takes place in Ancient Greece. Like God of War, the game uses ancient Greek mythology to build a game universe. The modified myth of Jason and the Argonauts, who went on a journey for the Golden Fleece was used as inspiration. According to the scriptwriters of the game, Jason is a Greek king, whose wife was killed in front of him. The only way for a grieving husband to return the beloved is the Golden Fleece, which can resurrect the dead. Other well-known heroes of myths appear in the game: Hercules, Achilles, Medea, Medusa, Patroclus, and others. Together they travel through a variety of real and imaginary locations: Iolcu, Delphi, Mycenae, Tartar, and Kifr.Key featuresThe game consists of a large number of dialogues and enemies confrontations on vast, detailed levels. In contrast to God of War, critics point out simple battles with bosses and the strange arrangement of enemies on each level, which also simplifies the gameplay. You can use a sword as a weapon, a spear, and a mace is also available. Each weapon has its own characteristics and offers different gameplay: the mace breaks shields, but can not cope with a large number of enemies, the sword reduces the player's defense capabilities, but increases the effectiveness of melee combat, etc. In addition to these weapons, you can upgrade Jason skills on four branches: Ares, Hermes, Apollo, and Athena.

It is a remake of WiiWare title Rubik's Puzzle Galaxy: Rush. Art-styleThe game’s art-style is very reminiscent of other Two Tribes title – Edge. It is extremely minimalistic. The levels themselves are mainly made of white cubes, and the other object is simplistic and colorful, and are mostly just geometrical shapes. GameplayThe game consists of more than 70 levels. Your goal is to guide multicolored cubes to a certain spot on the level throughout the multi-layered levels; the game world is fully 3D.To do so, you have to place individual tiles over the cubes’ course. They affect cubes’ direction and speed. There are also special tiles such as teleports. Each level has several entrance point and exits for the cubes of different colors. Some of them can have special objects like conveyor belts that affect cubes’ behavior. After the player places the tiles, they can press the button to start the movement of the cube. From this point, the player cannot affect them, and if any cubes collide or fall from the edge of the level, the stage restarts.The main concern for the developers was the maximum simplification of the controls so the player can focus on the puzzles alone, so all the movements in the game may be performed with the sole mouse.", user_id: nil},

Throughout the game players will be introduced to the mechanics of Sanity, representing the mental state of Daniel which can be affected by lack of light, visions and even unpleasant encounters with the monsters. When decreased, Sanity will distort the vision of the player to a different and seemingly random effect, in order to depict actual effects of severe anxiety. Most of the game challenges are completed through the item search and physics puzzles, forcing players to be resourceful and courageous.The game supports modding, and allows user-created content alongside the free DLC Justine, telling a story of a female prisoner.

S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl is set in Ukraine, in the infamous Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Several parts of the open-world setting were modeled after the real Chernobyl surroundings, including the power plant and the city of Pripyat, although designers took some liberties. The bleak environment and dark ambient music help to create an unsettling atmosphere of this place. According to the backstory, in 2006, the second Chernobyl disaster occurred, turning the surrounding area into post-apocalyptic ruins, full of grotesque mutants and time-space anomalies. The \"stalkers\" in this world are the explorers who wander The Zone in search of valuable loot. You play as the Marked One, a stalker who lost his memory. All that remains of his past is a memo that says “Kill Strelok”. The Marked One will have to learn more about himself, Strelok, The Zone, and its mysteries.

But the yarn that Yarni is made of is subject to him, he can catch on to the object, pull himself up and climb up, swing and jump, maybe even pull yarn and walk along it like a tightrope walker. The variety of these techniques is large enough, tips help to use them. You can interact with all objects, sometimes there are creatures that can block the path - for example, insects.Yarn can not be unrolled indefinitely, it is necessary to monitor its consumption. Sometimes you can return the unwound yarn back to the \"body\", sometimes you can increase the amount of yarn, finding a new piece.The most valuable thing Yarni finds is memories. Memories of a family of people, from which he \"comes\" himself. Memories are painted with different emotions, a sufficient number of collected memories opens the entrance to the following levels. In the game there are two lines of events. Events of the past arise as memories, they are found by Yarni. At the same time, the Yarni journey goes in the present - and also serves as a source of events that make up not the past but the present.", user_id: nil},

There are simply no limits to the carnage you can achieve in Epic Battle Simulator. Mess around with a massive variety of units. Everything from, Roman Centurions, Medieval soldiers, Knights, Orcs, Trolls, and yes, chickens! The main focus in this game is giving the player no restrictions to what he can do. That is why we decided not to limit the amount of units in battle. Want to see what a battle of 100,000 units looks like? We don't recommend going past 10,000 for most machines but its your CPU, do what you want! On top of that, you can play as any one of the units in the game, getting up close and personal to help change the tides of a massive battle, while rallying teammates and giving them orders!\rThe Technology:\rUnfortunately there really aren't many engines that you can chuck 10,000 characters in and expect good performance. This is why I worked months on end to create the most powerful crowd rendering system ever conceived in Unity engine. The detail of each character has little effect on performance while each individual acts independently, but is working towards a greater good for his team.  Each individual decides his own path and navigates complex environments. But I didn't stop there! With the large open environments, I needed a more dynamic lighting solution than the one built in to Unity engine. So I built my own dynamic global illumination lighting engine. This enables bounce light completely in real time. What does that mean? That means every piece of shiny armor is reflecting it's true surroundings, every bright surfaces illuminates it's surroundings and effects the overall lighting. \rYes I worked hard to bring this game to life, may you all inflict carnage upon it!", user_id: nil},

Your party can also stumble upon records left by a previous prisoner, Toorum, which don't really inspire hope. There's an achievement that unlocks Toorum as a playable character.", user_id: nil},

It was initially made for virtual reality headsets but also supports traditional screens and controls.Player cooperationThe game is meant to be played by at least two people in cooperation. Only one of them is wearing the VR headset or actually interacts with the computer. He or she acts as the main defuser who has to deactivate the bomb. All other players assume the roles of the experts. Their task is to help the defuser by reading aloud a manual about bombs. The experts need to be either in the same room with the defuser or to contact him or her over an audio messenger. The defuser is the only player who can see the bomb. He or she has to describe it in details to other players. The experts, in turn, have to find the described blocks in their manuals and tell the defuser what to do to solve the puzzle. Bombs as puzzlesThe composition and other attributes of each bomb are randomly generated for each level, and the players can customize them. The bombs consist of individual blocks, which are puzzles on their own. Some of the blocks require regular attention from the defuser, while others can be disarmed once and for all. The time for each level is limited. When the countdown reaches the end, the bomb will explode. Defuser's errors may also speed up the countdown or even activate the bomb and \"kill\" him or her.

It is based on mechanics typical for deck-building board games, but also features rogue-like and hack-and-slash elements. Its approach to the storytelling is typical for tabletop RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons. You play cards against the Dealer, who is both your DM, opponent, and narrator of your adventures. Each card represents an item, a character, or an encounter. You navigate your character through the story that unfurls as you reveal the cards and make your choices. The goal is to collect a powerful deck of cards that give your character better weapons, armor, and other equipment. You can unlock more cards after you defeat bosses and complete quests. The Dealer’s goal is to hamper your progress, as he plays his cards to put new obstacles in your way.Most of the time the game will only show you the cards and the Dealer who sits across the table from you. You will learn the events from listening to him and reading the text on cards. Battles, however, are actually fought in real time by animated characters on visualized 3D arenas.

Once again, the player controls Rufus, a selfish yet loveable rogue, who tries to leave his home planet Deponia and move to the luxurious space station Elysium. His cyborg girlfriend Goal got into trouble because of Rufus’s faults, and he has to save her. The plot, character interactions, and many jokes rely on the assumption that the player is already familiar with most characters from Deponia. However, in case you didn’t play the original game, there’s an introduction to familiarize you.Chaos on Deponia uses point-and-click controls, which are usually better suited for mouses and keyboards. However, the developers claim to make sure that playing with a console’s controller is just as fluid and natural. The analog stick stands in for the mouse, while the buttons control various actions Rufus can do to objects and other characters. Like in most adventure games, the protagonist has to use various items to solve puzzles. Those are quite complex right from the start, and there’s no growing difficulty over the course of Chaos on Deponia.", user_id: nil},

Your goal is to navigate it through the dangerous 2D space, avoid asteroids and fight off enemy ships and space monsters. Every time the ship hits an object, it loses some of its health. The spaceship contains several devices, such as thrusters, laser cannons, and deflector shields, and one character can only control one device at a time. To keep the ship running and safe, the protagonists have to constantly move around the ship to activate a certain device. This is why, although Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime can also be played alone, the game is strongly oriented towards the cooperative multiplayer. Up to four players can participate and form a crew to thoroughly control every device. Even in the single-player mode, there’s the second protagonist, presumably your character's lover, who is controlled by the AI and obeys your orders.

In the Steam community, there are still enthusiastic nostalgic reviews of almost everything that concerns Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory. And there is an explanation for this. The game was released in 2005 and became the third in the Splinter Cell series. Canadian studio Ubisoft Montreal was engaged in the development, who is also responsible for Assassin's Creed and Far Cry. Critics and player noted the Xbox and PC versions of the game as the best. The storyIn Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, the player will feel like a professional spy, NSA agent Sam Fisher from a special unit called “The Third Echelon.” The plot takes its origin from the first game in the series. However, the narrative is constructed in such a way that the player does not necessarily have to go through it in order to enjoy the story. The events of the game occur in different parts of the Earth that are based on places from the real world. At the heart of the game is the conflict unfolding between China, North Korea, South Korea, and Japan.In addition to a single user campaign, there is the possibility of playing on the net. However, the official online services for this game were disabled as early as August 2016. Despite this, players still have the opportunity to play on the local network or, with due skill - through third-party services.", user_id: nil},

Gameplay-wise, it’s a regular 2D shoot ’em up in space, not unlike Asteroids or Project Starfighter. The player controls a small starship that fires at everything on the screen, from asteroids to enemy spacecraft, in order to survive. When hit by an obstacle or by enemy fire, the ship explodes. The goal is to survive as long as possible and score more points to unlock bonuses and receive ranks.What makes gameplay in Beat Hazard innovative is that every level is based on a song from the player’s music collection. The song defines the speed and rhythm of the game. A similar approach was previously used in Audiosurf, but never before in a shoot ’em up. Enemy attacks, your ship’s fire, and power-ups are synchronized to the song and can be predicted if you remember the tune well. The difficulty is also dependent on music. A power ballad or an ambient piece will do for a slow, meditative play, while a trance or heavy metal composition will turn the game into madness. The game’s visuals are very bright and feature many rapid flashes, which makes Beat Hazard not recommended for people with epilepsy.", user_id: nil},

From the genre of the shooter from the third person the game took a powerful action in the entourage of several visual styles - comics of the 50's, neon lights of the 80's and 90's, cold dynamics of the 00's. Much in the design of locations is a quote or allusions to famous works of science fiction of the fifties.Instead of the invasion of the Reds, an invasion from the Red PlanetMars invades the US with its iconic 50s-styled flying saucers, insectoid drones, various robots in the size of a skyscraper, rolling balls that turn into death machines on stilts, floating bombs, iconic 50's-styled flying saucers. The aliens are rolling in waves, from different directions.Sci-Fi archetypesCharacters that can be played correspond to the chosen style of pulp-sci-fi, including a jetpack piloting heroine, a shotgun wielding space cowboy, a secret government agent, and a battle hardened Marine captain.You can play on behalf of one of the characters, but you can also unite with others, and this will give the most guaranteed victory.GameplayYou can fight in different ways - attack the aliens, personally shooting them, or building a network of defensive structures. When building, you can use money, sell unnecessary.You can alternate the way of action - to run and shoot, and then to build something and so on. Of course, in this situation, there is no time for deep strategic calculations, so the strategic part of the game is not as elaborate as in the games of the strategic genre itself.The canon of the genre tower defense is presented in the game much more fully - there are quite useful tools, a great variety of units.

The player controls the only character who enters a dangerous underground maze to find and defeat the evil Lord Dredmor. As you descend deeper into the ground, the difficulty will grow. Each dungeon is generated randomly with each replay. There are three levels of difficulty, and also an option to turn on the permanent death mechanic. If you choose it, the game will leave you with only one save file to overwrite, and no save-scumming. There’s a traditional turn-based combat system and a variety of melee and ranged attacks, as well as magic. When the characters levels up, the player can improve his or her set of seven skills that can allow, among other things, to craft, disarm traps, use spells or wield more powerful weapons. The game is played from the overhead point of view on a map divided into square tiles. The visuals are relatively simple, albeit not as minimalistic as traditional ASCII-based rogue-like games. The imagery is quite cartoonish and ironic, which adds to the game’s self-aware dark humor. The main character will complain about his or her fate, and when he or she dies, which is quite often, the game will “congratulate” you for each death.", user_id: nil},

The game follows six main heroes, five of which are members of the elite military organization called SeeD, on their quest to defeat Ultimecia, an evil sorceress who wishes to compress time. Like its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII, the game heavily focuses on its story, characters and game world exposure.  GameplayThe gameplay of Final Fantasy VIII shares many similarities with other JRPGs of that era. The player can explore the overworld, visit different locations such as town, settlements, forests, interact with NPCs and fight numerous types of monsters in turn-based battles.While the world exploration aspect, for the most part, is similar to that of the previous game, the battle system has several notable differences. The combat in the game is centered on Junction system that allows the player to junction summoned monsters known as Guardian Forces to platy members. That gives characters the ability to use various magic, alter their stats and draw spells from enemies during the battles. Because of the system’s flexibility regarding character customization, the game is absent of job system typical for the series.", user_id: nil},

The game consists of matches: two 15-layers teams try to destroy the opponent’s castle and protect their own.In Happy Wars you can choose between three types of characters: the warrior, the mage, and the cleric. They also have subclasses that define their specification. For example, Berserker is stronger than an ordinary warrior and more suitable for protecting lines. In general, every class has their unique abilities that can be upgraded with the in-game currency and real money. Wisely balanced teams have more chances to win battles.The key feature that differs Happy Wars from other MOBA-type games is that before you destroy your opponent’s base you need to build yours. Bases are equipped with multiple weapons so it’s hard to get close to the enemy rift. Besides the center, there are several control points; the most massive battles are usually held near them.

Players will have to carry a lantern and hunt down several monsters in each of a few in-game chapters. Unlike Amnesia, Overcast has gunplay, map system, and scarce checkpoints, adding the high risk of replaying the chapter from the beginning, if players lost focus and made a mistake of dying too close, to the end of the chapter.

There are three distinct monster types, and each of them introduced from a first-person perspective of the said monster, adding to the tension.

It is considered one of the most significant and influential titles in video game history, for having helped to pioneer the now-ubiquitous first-person shooter. The original game was divided into three nine-level episodes and was distributed via shareware and mail order. The Ultimate Doom, an updated release of the original game featuring a fourth episode, was released in 1995 and sold at retail.In Doom, players assume the role of an unnamed space marine, who became popularly known as \"Doomguy\", fighting his way through hordes of invading demons from Hell. With one-third of the game (nine levels) distributed as shareware, Doom was played by an estimated 15–20 million people within two years of its release, popularizing both the business model of online distribution and the mode of gameplay, and spawning a gaming subculture. In addition to popularizing the first-person shooter genre, it pioneered immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer gaming, and support for customized additions and modifications via packaged files in a data archive known as \"WADs\". As a sign of its effect on the industry, first-person shooter games from the genre's boom in the 1990s, helped in no small part by the game's release, became known simply as \"Doom clones\". Its graphic violence, as well as satanic imagery, made Doom the subject of considerable controversy.The Doom franchise was later continued with the follow-up Doom II: Hell on Earth (1994) and numerous expansion packs, including Master Levels for Doom II (1995), and Final Doom (1996). Originally released for MS-DOS, the games have been ported to numerous other platforms. Once the game's source code was released in 1997, it spawned even more adaptations, as fans further ported the code to countless devices. The series started to lose mainstream appeal as the technology of the Doom game engine was surpassed in the mid-1990s, although fans have continued making Wads, speedruns, and modifications to the original. The franchise again received popular attention in 2004 with the release of Doom 3, a retelling of the original game using id Tech 4, with an associated 2005 Doom motion picture.

Nothing is known about the enemy, and the human government is unable to deploy its military forces quickly. The story revolves around a military court process against the four-person Kilo squad. GameplayJust like in all previous installments of Gears of War, Judgment is a third-person shooter featuring an over the shoulder perspective with an addition of an advanced cover system.The levels of the game are not as open as they used to be in the previous games. Now, the players fight in small and dense urban environments. Missions serve as self-contained story parts with no backtracking present in the gameplay.The game features a scoring system that evaluates the player's performance. There are two main criteria that matter: a number of the player kills and the number of headshots made. A harder difficulty is offered before the mission launch. This can activate a special weapon restriction or set a time limit. Completing a level on such difficulty will increase your score.The game also features a multiplayer mode that was not changed much since the last game apart from the addition of two new game modes: OverRun and Free-for-All. Eight maps are available to the players.", user_id: nil},

GameplayThe core gameplay is similar to most other PAC-MAN games. The player controls Pac-Man through the maze where he must eat dots and avoid hostile ghosts. Besides dots, the player can collect bonus items that give additional points, and power pellets that allow Pac-Man to eat ghosts. Eating several ghosts in a row triggers a combo that gives the player a huge amount of extra points. Though the base gameplay is similar to that of the original arcade game, there are numerous new mechanics and gameplay differences in Championship Edition DX. The mazes consist of two halves. Eating all the dots on one of them makes a bonus item appear on the other half and eating an item makes a new dots layout appear on the other side. If a ghost is about to catch Pac-Man, a slow-motion effect kicks in giving the player an opportunity to avoid it. There are three main game modes in the game: Score Attack, Time Attack, and Ghost Combo. The game features nine different courses and several visual style options.

Final parts of the game resemble the hardcore platformers like Super Meat Boy more than they resemble traditional skating games like Tony Hawk.The title is also being praised for the soundtrack — it matches the indie stylistics and is available for sale separately.", user_id: nil},

These included 2.5D reboots of Golden Axe, Altered Beast, and Streets of Rage, as well as an endless runner version of Shinobi, all encompassed in a universal hub world. Sadly SEGA Studios Australia’s doors were shuttered in 2013, and with it the SEGA Reborn project was lost to the annals of video game history. Until now. On the occasion of SEGA’s 60th Anniversary, as a special treat to say “Thank You!” to our fans, SEGA is releasing a working prototype of Golden Axe Reborn, a single level created as proof-of-concept, or what’s known in the industry as a “vertical slice.”  We’ve dubbed it, tongue in cheek, as “Golden Axed.”  Golden Axed offers a unique glimpse into the prospect of a project that could have been, and a rare peek behind the curtain at the sometimes tumultuous world of video game development. We reached out to some of the original development team to bring this dusty gem to light, and they are proud that this project could be revived in some form to be shared with you, the fans.*Available until 10am PST / 6PM BST October 19th*", user_id: nil},

A virus attack led to a machine uprising, and Mighty No. 9 is among the few robots that were not infected. His creator, Dr. White, sends him to stop his rampaging kin and find out who is behind the attack. The Xel technology allows Beck to bring his fellow Numbers back to reason. He will also assimilate their data to send it back to the lab so that Dr. White could find the cure for the virus. Beck is occasionally assisted by Call, a female robot unaffected by the virus.GameplayThe player controls Beck in a 2D environment. Like in Mega Man, the protagonist jumps platforms and fires a gun. Beck can also use the special acceleration ability that allows him to leap long distances and through his enemies. By leaping through injured opponents, Beck can assimilate their Xel to receive a temporary power-up. The type of a power-up depends on the color of a Xel: red gives Beck more powerful attacks, green speeds him up, yellow improves his stamina, and blue heals him.

Further into the game, the levels are no longer set in a house, but in a park with the landscapes of it being used for several puzzles. From level to level, several gameplay mechanics change with the only gameplay element that stays the same is the character movement or item interaction. Everything else is subject to change. These gameplay elements can be used as a puzzle piece in several levels, but most of the time they create an obstacle for the player to pass.The developers put a heavy emphasis on the fact that gameplay mechanics were meant to be experimental and unpredictable. This effect is achieved by avoiding the use of the “What you see is what you get” principle. There are multiple unexpected turns present in the game.
